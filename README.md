Course Description:
This course provides an advanced course in computer programming for students with a solid background
in introductory Java. Topics include objects and classes in Java, object-oriented programming design,
inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, recursion, and advanced data structures. While the focus of the
course will be object-oriented programming in Java, students with experience in other languages (such as
C/C++ or Python) will be encouraged to pursue independent projects that allow them to study the
implementation of these same concepts in the context of other programming languages. The course will
also help students to further develop good coding practices that are universal to the process of
programming, whatever the language. This course follows the ACM guidelines for CS 1.
Course Objectives:
This course aims to build on prior programming experience by introducing Java as a second programming
language. Students will develop an understanding of Java syntax and object-oriented programming
concepts, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, while strengthening problem-solving skills
through the use of methods, arrays, basic data structures, exception handling, and recursion. Emphasis is
placed on writing clear, well-structured, and maintainable code.
Learning Outcomes:
At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:
• Design and implement Java programs using core programming constructs and object-oriented
principles such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
• Apply problem-solving techniques using methods, arrays, basic data structures, recursion, and
exception handling.
• Write, test, and debug well-structured Java code following standard coding conventions and best
practices.
• Compare and transfer programming concepts learned in Python to their implementation in Java,
recognizing key differences between the languages.
Textbook:
Core Java, Vol. I: Fundamentals, 14th Edition, By Cay S. Horstmann
(https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/core-java-vol/9780135558553/ )
The textbook for this course is free using your school email.
Programming Tool (free, install to your computer):
Eclipse IDE: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/
Course Requirements:
Course Engagement
• Completion of weekly readings, video lectures, and practice exercises.
• Active participation in online discussion forums or peer review activities.
• Submission of assignments and discussions by posted deadlines.
Academic Integrity
• All work must be original and comply with the institution’s academic honesty policies. You should
not be utilizing AI to complete assignments! You can use it as a guide, but you must still complete
your own work. If I can reproduce your submission using AI, that is a integrity violation.
Withdrawal Policy:
Students that wish to withdraw from a class after the conclusion of the Add/Drop period during the first
week of classes must contact a Learner Mentor/Guided Pathways Specialist to initiate a course withdrawal
form.
Attendance Policy:
For purposes of this policy, attendance at the College in online courses includes:
• Submitting an academic assignment or participating in a discussion forum showing the student’s
participation about an academic matter.
Faculty members are required to record attendance at least once a week if the course is fully online.
Students must be dropped by faculty from courses for non-attendance after the drop/add period ends. If
you have disappeared from the class for an extended period of time (i.e., missing multiple weeks in a
row), then you may be withdrawn from the class. Attendance for classes is determined by completing
assignments as scheduled. Simply logging into Canvas does not fulfill the attendance requirement. A
student who fails to attend a course as outlined in the course syllabus will be withdrawn from the course
by the instructor for excessive absenteeism.
Grading:
Your final course grade will be calculated and weighted based on the following categories.
Course Grading Breakdown
Discussions 5%
Quizzes 10%
Exams 20%
Assignments 25%
Coding Labs 40%
Your Canvas Grade Book is the official calculation of your grade in this course.
Standard 10-point Grading Scale
A 90 -100
B 80 – 90
C 70 – 80
D 60 – 70
F 0 – 60
Late Work:
Late work is not allowed unless specifically approved by your instructor.
• Standard Penalty: Assignments submitted up to 5 days late will incur a 10% deduction from
the total possible score.
• After 5 Days: Assignments will incur a 20% deduction from the total possible score.
• Extensions: Students may request an extension before the due date for documented
emergencies or exceptional circumstances. Approval is at the instructor’s discretion.
• Technical Issues: Technical problems (e.g., internet outages, computer failures) are not valid
reasons for missing deadlines unless reported promptly and documented. Students are
encouraged to submit early to avoid last-minute issues.
Final Exam:
There will be final exam for this course. The test will be administered online and available during the full
final exam week for you to complete. It is not an open-note test. If you miss the exam, you cannot make it
up.
Academic Integrity:
Plagiarism—using or presenting the ideas, code, or writings of another as your own—is a serious violation
of academic integrity and is unacceptable. The college subscribes to plagiarism detection services to help
identify uncredited work. Using the words, ideas, or code of others, including AI-generated content,
without proper attribution will result in a zero on the assignment.
Depending on the severity of the violation, students may receive an automatic F in the course and face
disciplinary action from the college. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse, as proper
attribution and academic integrity will be covered thoroughly in class. When using AI tools to assist with
assignments, students must clearly indicate how AI was used and ensure that the work submitted reflects
their own understanding and effort.
Honorlock
Honorlock will proctor your exams this semester. Honorlock is an online proctoring service that allows
you to take your exam from the comfort of your home. You DO NOT need to create an account, download
software or schedule an appointment in advance. Honorlock is available 24/7, and all that is needed is a
computer, a working webcam/microphone, your ID, and a stable internet connection.
To get started, you will need Google Chrome and download the Honorlock Chrome Extension.
When you are ready to complete your assessment, log into Canvas, go to your course, and click on your
exam. Clicking "Launch Proctoring" will begin the Honorlock authentication process, where you will take
a picture of yourself, show your ID, and complete a scan of your room. Honorlock will be recording your
exam session through your webcam, microphone, and recording your screen. Honorlock also has an
integrity algorithm that can detect search-engine use, so please do not attempt to search for answers, even
if it's on a secondary device.
